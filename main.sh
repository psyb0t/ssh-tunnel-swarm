# Function to establish an SSH connection to a remote host and create tunnels based on pre-defined rules.

# $1 - user_host_port: A string containing the username, hostname, and port number to connect to, separated by colons. Example: "john@example.com:22"
# $2 - raw_tunnel_rules: A string containing semicolon-separated tunnel rules, where each tunnel rule is in the format "direction interface_ports", separated by spaces. Example: "forward 8080:localhost:80;reverse 2222:localhost:22"
